How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I ensure my project is functional and secure be carefully reviewing requirements and artifacts. Then, using the requirements I create the code/module/software to meet the requirements. Finally ensure a robust testing stragety to include edge cases.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Translating users needs into clearly defined functional or nonfunctional requirement takes time and skill. Communication and follow up with the customer is essential to ensure their needs and expetations are meet.

How do I approach designing software?
The most important part of software design is defining the scope of the project. Second to defining and building requirements, is a robust testing stragety. Ensuring testing is automated where appropriate, frequent enough to catch bugs, compatability issues, and edge cases helps keep the project on task.
